## Project Name: 30MinFilm

## Project Description:

The project involves a website mainly designed to help students navigate good places to have fun and relax outside of campus during the summer. Most students at NYU Abu Dhabi know about these places however people do not consider these places as an option when it comes to relaxing; I could say that from my personal experience. Hence the website helps students to navigate these places and get to know them well. Particularly in the summer when the weather is very harsh and most dining venues on campus are a good option without going too far from campus.

## Process: 

First I designed a simple wireframe and decided to use a scrolling effect to better incorporate the siteâ€™s main goal to the design. On the wireframe, I designed each page to take the whole screen to increase user engagement and experience. Moreover, to make users spend more time on each page I made a snapping effect where the page sticks to the top or bottom without hanging in the middle while also filling the entire screen. Such design technique was important to increase user engagement. 
The website has three navigation means namely scrolling through a mouse or trackpad, using the scroll button, and the nav bar menu. I used each element for a reason the mouse scrolling effect provides a simple user interface allowing users to navigate the site through just a scroll. Meanwhile, I included another scroll button functionality with an animation to give a more natural and appealing feature to the site. And, in some cases, a trackpad is not the most effective way to scroll through content unless the user has a mouse. The navbar adds more freedom of navigation for the user allowing users to jump from one end to another without the need to scroll multiple times. Furthermore, users are more likely to use the nav bar when they want to jump to further content or want to revisit the page. Hence, I added an interactive functionality where the video on each page starts from a certain point in time when the user navigates through the site.  

## Reflection:

The website satisfies the initial goals since it has an appealing home page and interactive interfaces. However, there are some issues I could not address due to the time constraint. Responsiveness is one of them. The site loses some of its traits, particularly on the pages except the home page. This might be an issue when it comes to mobile phones deployment on mobile phones. The design is also very simple which is not ideal. Adding more interactive features and animation would make the site more attractive. Optimization is also another issue. The code base of the site contains some repetitions which could have been avoided. Such optimization issues might slow down the website. Nevertheless, the website meets the goal or can serve as a stepping stone for updating and adding features to make the site more interactive and user-friendly.
