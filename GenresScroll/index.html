			The pop genre, short for popular music, is a broad and ever-evolving genre that encompasses a wide range of musical styles 
			and influences. Pop music is characterized by its catchy melodies, accessible lyrics, and broad appeal to a wide audience.

			Pop music has its roots in the mid-1950s, drawing influences from various genres such as rock and roll, R&B, and country. 
			It gained widespread popularity in the 1960s with the rise of acts like The Beatles, The Beach Boys, and Motown artists, 
			who brought a fresh and energetic sound to the music scene.

			Throughout the decades, pop music has continued to evolve and adapt to changing trends and tastes. In the 1980s, pop 
			took on a more electronic and synthesized sound, with acts such as Michael Jackson, Madonna, and Prince leading the way.

			In recent years, pop music has continued to evolve and diversify, with artists exploring a range of styles and subgenres 
			within the pop umbrella. This includes influences from alternative pop, indie pop, EDM, Latin pop, and more. Artists like 
			Taylor Swift, Billie Eilish, Ariana Grande, Dua Lipa, and BTS have been at the forefront of shaping the contemporary pop 
			landscape.

			Pop music's appeal lies in its ability to connect with a wide audience through its catchy hooks, relatable lyrics, and 
			production that often prioritizes radio-friendly sounds. It remains one of the most commercially successful genres, 
			dominating charts and popular culture worldwide.

			House music is a genre of electronic dance music that originated 
			in the early 1980s in Chicago, United States. It is characterized by
			 repetitive four-on-the-floor beats, synthesized basslines, and 
			 prominent use of electronic instruments and samples. House music often incorporates elements of 
			 disco, funk, and soul, with influences from various other genres.

			The term "house" is said to derive from the Warehouse nightclub in Chicago, where DJ Frankie Knuckles and 
			other DJs played a style of music that would eventually become known as house music. House music quickly gained popularity in the underground club scene and eventually spread to other cities in the United States and around the world.

			In the 1980s and 1990s, house music underwent various subgenre developments, including acid house, deep house, 
			progressive house, and garage house. These subgenres introduced different elements and styles while still maintaining the core characteristics of house music.

			House music has had a significant influence on the development of electronic dance music as a whole and has 
			become a staple in clubs, festivals, and music scenes worldwide. It has also influenced other genres of music, such as pop, hip hop, and R&B, and has had a lasting impact on contemporary music production techniques.
			Prominent house music artists include Frankie Knuckles, Larry Heard (also known as Mr. Fingers), Marshall Jefferson, Inner City, Daft Punk, Disclosure, Duke Dumont, and many more.

			Hip-hop is a genre of music and cultural movement that originated in African American and Latinx communities in the Bronx, New York City, in the 1970s. It encompasses various elements, including rapping (vocal delivery of rhymes), DJing (turntablism and beat-making), breakdancing (physical movement and dance), and graffiti art.

			Hip-hop music is characterized by its rhythmic and rhyming vocal style, often delivered over a beat or instrumental track. It commonly addresses social and cultural issues, personal experiences, storytelling, and boasts. Hip-hop is known for its use of sampling, where portions of existing songs are incorporated into new compositions, creating a collage-like effect.

			The genre has evolved over time, giving rise to various subgenres and styles, including old-school hip-hop, golden age hip-hop, gangsta rap, conscious rap, alternative hip-hop, trap, and more. Each subgenre has its own distinct sound, lyrical themes, and cultural influences.

			Hip-hop has had a significant impact on popular culture and has become one of the most influential music genres globally. It has shaped fashion, language, dance, visual arts, and has provided a platform for artists to express their creativity and voice their perspectives on social and political issues.

			Notable hip-hop artists and groups throughout its history include Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five, Run-D.M.C., Public Enemy, N.W.A., Tupac Shakur, The Notorious B.I.G., Jay-Z, Nas, Eminem, Kanye West, Kendrick Lamar, and many others.

			Trap is a subgenre of hip-hop music that originated in the Southern United States, particularly in Atlanta, Georgia, in the early 2000s. It is characterized by its hard-hitting beats, heavy use of 808 drum machines, rapid hi-hat patterns, and dark, atmospheric soundscapes. The term "trap" originally referred to places where drugs were sold and the lifestyle associated with them, and the music reflects the gritty and often dangerous environment of urban neighborhoods.

			Trap music often incorporates elements from electronic music, incorporating synthesizers, vocal samples, and trap-specific sound effects. The lyrics of trap songs typically focus on themes such as street life, drug culture, violence, materialism, and personal struggles. The delivery of the lyrics is often characterized by a rhythmic and melodic style, with artists using unique flows and ad-libs to add energy and personality to their performances.

			In addition to its musical elements, trap has also influenced fashion, dance, and popular culture. The genre has gained significant popularity and commercial success, with trap artists achieving mainstream recognition and topping charts worldwide.

			Some notable trap artists include Drake, Gucci Mane, 21 Savage, Young Jeezy, Future, Migos, Travis Scott, Lil Baby, and many others. Producers such as Metro Boomin and 808 Mafia contributed for rise of dark trap sounds with haunting melodies. The sound and style of trap continue to evolve, with artists experimenting and blending trap with other genres, pushing its boundaries and maintaining its influence in contemporary hip-hop music.
